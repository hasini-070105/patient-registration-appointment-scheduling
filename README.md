# patient-registration-appointment-scheduling
We should get the patients  registered in our hospital if not we can get them  registered. Then we can give them appointments  according to the availability of the respective doctor by  taking some basic inputs such as patients ID, date on  which they wanted the appointment and so on.Upon  that we can view our appointment.
